# Paper-trading ledger — 2026-11-07 20:10 UTC

123 runs over 24.19 days (since 2026-10-14). Every detected opportunity is re-priced a few seconds later at real quotes; "realised" is what a full-size taker fill would have made then, net of fees.

## Carry positions (long spot / short perp, paper)

| Open | Closed | Wins | Funding | Leg P&L | Fees | Closed P&L | Open P&L | Mean hold |

## Go-live gate

- **cross-exchange**: ✅ passed
- **triangular**: ⛔ not yet — only 24 verified samples (need 30)
- **carry**: ⛔ not yet — only 6 closed paper positions (need 10); cumulative closed P&L is -86.81 (need > 0); win rate 33% (need 55%)

> Paper fills assume taker orders at the re-priced book with no queue position and no exchange latency beyond the verification delay. Real fills are worse, never better. The gate is a necessary condition for live trading, not a sufficient one.
