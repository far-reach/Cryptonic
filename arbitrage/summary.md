# Paper-trading ledger — 2026-10-24 21:51 UTC

62 runs over 10.26 days (since 2026-10-14). Every detected opportunity is re-priced a few seconds later at real quotes; "realised" is what a full-size taker fill would have made then, net of fees.

## Carry positions (long spot / short perp, paper)

## Go-live gate

- **cross-exchange**: ✅ passed
- **triangular**: ⛔ not yet — only 18 verified samples (need 30)
- **carry**: ⛔ not yet — only 1 closed paper positions (need 10); cumulative closed P&L is -59.7 (need > 0); win rate 0% (need 55%)

> Paper fills assume taker orders at the re-priced book with no queue position and no exchange latency beyond the verification delay. Real fills are worse, never better. The gate is a necessary condition for live trading, not a sufficient one.
